Article I. Clause I. The Creation and Organization of Files in the Test Repository

All files, which comprise some facet of the kernel, shall, in no manner, contain
trailing whitespaces, or otherwise, either by whatever accident or purpose, contain
excessive or unnecessary whitespaces. All lines, in addition, which comprise the
heretofore addressed files, shall, under no condition, hold more than eighty-five
characters under their expanses; there is, however, no formal rule adjudging the
smallest number of characters within a single line, though, within written files,
that is, within files, which are not fundamental to the operation of the kernel, as
well as within comments, the general rule holds, that lines should, at least, reach
eighty characters.

All parts, both files and directories, which comprise some facet of the kernel,
shall, according to their purpose therefore, be named explicity and concisely. If a
single title cannot easily be applied to a certain file or directory, then the
responsibility rests upon the author, either to move the contents of that file or of
that directory under two or more separate heads, or otherwise to endeavor to better
unite the contents therein. If the title of one of the aforementioned parts require,
that two or more separate words be used to describe the contents of whatever part to
which this file is dedicated, then the author, again using his own intuition, shall
take it upon himself to concatenate these words with the appropriate number of
underscores.

All files, which are fundamental to the operation of the kernel, shall contain, as
their primary portion, a comment, which concisely underlines the purpose of that file
within the kernel itself.
