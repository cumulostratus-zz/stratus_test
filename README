	Stratus kernel test repository.

Article I. Clause I. The Creation and Organization of Files in the Test Repository

All files, which comprise some facet of the kernel, shall, in no manner, contain
trailing whitespaces, or otherwise, either by whatever accident or purpose, contain
excessive or unnecessary whitespaces. All lines, in addition, which comprise the
heretofore addressed files, shall, under no condition, hold more than eighty-five
characters under their expanses; there is, however, no formal rule adjudging the
smallest number of characters within a single line, though, within written files,
that is, within files, which are not fundamental to the operation of the kernel, as
well as within comments, the general rule holds, that lines should, at least, reach
eighty characters.
